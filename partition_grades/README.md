# Coding Challenge
This is a coding challenge from a recent interview. The problem given was to partition a list of grades such that passing grades were on one side of the list and failing grades were on the other side. The passing grades are to be maintained in the order in which they are encountered. My initial thought was to maintain two lists of pass and fails respectively and merge afterwards. This had a linear complexity for both time and space. Was asked to improve my code so the space complexity was constant time. After discussions with the interviewer, I came up with the solution included here.

This was the most tensed I've been for any skills test, and considering the simplicity of the problem, I am still trying to understand why.
